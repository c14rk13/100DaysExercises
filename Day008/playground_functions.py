# Love Calculator
# # ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª
# # You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.  To work out the love score between two people:
# # 1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# # 2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# # 3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.
# # e.g.
# # name1 = "Angela Yu" name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# # T occurs 0 times
# # R occurs 1 time
# # U occurs 2 times
# # E occurs 2 times
# # Total = 5
#
# L occurs 1 time
# # O occurs 0 times
# # V occurs 0 times
# # E occurs 2 times
# # Total = 3
#
# # Love Score = 53
#
# # Example Input
# # calculate_love_score("Kanye West", "Kim Kardashian")
# # Example Output
# # 42
